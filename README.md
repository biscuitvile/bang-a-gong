# Bang A Gong

This repository is a cloneable template for more quickly getting started
with a Rails mountable engine. It makes some opinionated assumptions about gem
dependencies:

* Devise
* jQuery
* Haml
* Simple Form
* RSpec
* Capybara
* Factory Girl
* Database Cleaner
* SQLite

Run `thor engine:rename` to rename the engine after cloning.
